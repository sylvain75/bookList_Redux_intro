#App State with redux

__Component State !== Application State

__Redux in charge of the application state__

__React provides views to display state__

__Application state generated by reducer function__

##Folders

![Folder Structure](/images/folders_Structure.png)

###Reducers folder:
reducers_books.js -> array containing list of object where each object contains list of books with title as key
index.js ->
```
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import BooksReducer from './reducer_books';

//_book reducer added to combineReducers_
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
	//_reducer add key (books) and value of what returns (BooksReducer=array of books) to the global application state_
  books: BooksReducer
});

export default rootReducer;
```

###Containers folder
```Book_list.js``` __depends on the state so had to be "promoted" in the container folder__
####difference with components folder:
```import { connect } from 'react-redux';``` to be able to use the ```connect``` function linking React and Redux libraries
```
function mapStateToProps( state ) {
  // Whatever it returned will show up as props inside of BookList
  return {
    books: state.books
  };
}
```

```export default connect( mapStateToProps )( BookList )```

__in ```app.js``` make sure BookList is rendered.__
